Firstly, you need to fetch the submodules:

	git submodule init
	git submodule update

Now everything will compile.

The minimalist branch has a number of features removed, and may interest you.

Mediation
---------
This client can mediate scrobbles from multiple clients. It has a fully
featured Applescript interface to allow this. However currently Last.fm's user
page will always say "iTunes" as the player. This is because even though we
wrote this awesome mediating interface, we only use iTunes with it so never
mind eh?
