A minimal OS X iTunes scrobbling solution that implements Audioscrobbler
protocol 2.0.

To compile it you'll need to set the missing #defines in lastfm.m to your
[Last.fm key and secret](http://www.last.fm/api/account). Build the project to
get the compile errors to see what the defines are called.
